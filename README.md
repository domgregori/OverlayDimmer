## OverlayDimmer

I have some displays that you can not adjust the back light with utilities. So I made this extension that uses an overlay to dim the screen instead.

### How to use

Toggle overlay by clicking the icon in the status bar. Right click to adjust the dimmness.
Settings are accessed in the extension manager.

### TODO

- [ ] Add a slider, activated by right click, to change how much to dim.
- [ ] Make a settings page
  - Color of icon
  - Default dimmness
    - Cap top and bottom opacity
- [ ] Make _pref_ to save settings
